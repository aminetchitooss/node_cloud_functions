## How to use
  
  Make sure to set up a "config.json" file to get the following variables
  
    
```json
project_id  :  XXXX
privateKey  :  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\XXXXXX
clientEmail :  firebase-adminsdk- XXXX
```
  then run these commands 
  
```bash
npm i

npm start

#with nodemon (restart server with every save)
